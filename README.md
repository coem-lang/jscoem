# jscoem

This is the JavaScript implementation of my Coem language. This was built by adapting my Java code (based on Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)) into JavaScript, following the example of [YALI.js](https://github.com/danman113/YALI.js) by Daniel Berezin (danman113).

## Setup

```
npm install
```

To run in the command line:
```
npm start
```

To debug:

I use VS Code's Node debug tools.

To build to `dist/coem.js`:
```
npm run build
```
